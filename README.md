# Portfolio (monorepo)

This repository contains a single project with separate `frontend` and `backend` folders.

Quick commands from the repository root:

- Install dependencies for both packages:

```bash
npm install
```

- Start both dev servers concurrently:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or start only one side:

```bash
npm run start:frontend
npm run start:backend
```
